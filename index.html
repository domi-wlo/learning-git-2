				<h1>Is Everybody Going Crazy?</h1>
				<h4> by Nothing But Thieves </h4>
				<p>I saw you down the neighborhood <br>
					And I understood <br>
					Spiritual hangover that I can't shake <br>
					It's getting more than I can take <br>
					And in this restless, disfigured place <br>
					We've only got each other <br>
				</p>
				<p>I just wanna go blur the line <br>
					And leave our afflictions behind <br>
					The sky is coming down <br>
					I know it's strange <br>
					But heaven's a mindset away <br>
				</p>
				<p> Yeah, everybody's going crazy <br>
					Can't get through to you lately <br>
					We're so hopelessly faded <br> 
					Is anyone else feeling lonely? <br>
					It just can't be me only <br>
					Losing our cool so slowly <br>
					It would feel so good to <br>
					Steal some time <br>
					It would feel so good to <br>
					Make you mine <br>
